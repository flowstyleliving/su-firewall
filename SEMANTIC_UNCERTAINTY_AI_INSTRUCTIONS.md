# 🧮 Semantic Uncertainty AI Instructions

## 📋 Overview
This guide enables AI systems to implement semantic uncertainty thinking using the breakthrough equation **ℏₛ = √(Δμ × Δσ)** for enhanced decision-making and risk assessment.

## 🔬 Core Equation
```
ℏₛ(C) = √(Δμ × Δσ)
```

**Where:**
- **Δμ**: Precision (semantic clarity, stability, focused meaning)
- **Δσ**: Flexibility (adaptability, chaos potential, unpredictability)
- **ℏₛ**: Semantic uncertainty (combined stress measurement)

## 🎯 Risk Classification System

### 🔴 High Collapse Risk
- **ℏₛ < 1.0**: Immediate attention required
- **Actions**: Escalate, defer, block
- **Emojis**: 🔴 🚨 🛑

### 🟡 Moderate Instability  
- **1.0 ≤ ℏₛ < 1.2**: Monitor closely
- **Actions**: Careful monitoring, cautious proceed
- **Emojis**: 🟡 ⚡ 🧠

### 🟢 Stable Operations
- **ℏₛ ≥ 1.2**: Proceed normally
- **Actions**: Execute, approve, optimize
- **Emojis**: 🟢 ✅ 🚀
