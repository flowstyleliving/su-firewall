## 📈 **Streamlining Results**

### **Before Cleanup:**
- **25 JavaScript files** (bloated, redundant)
- **Multiple overlapping systems** (confusing)
- **Scattered functionality** (hard to maintain)

### **After Cleanup:**
- **12 JavaScript files** (streamlined, focused)
- **Clear separation of concerns** (organized)
- **Production-ready structure** (maintainable)
