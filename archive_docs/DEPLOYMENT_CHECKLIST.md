# üöÄ Phase 1 Live Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Requirements

### ‚úÖ **Environment Setup**
- [ ] WASM module compiled and working: `wasm-pack build --target web --release`
- [ ] 0G Newton Testnet RPC accessible: `https://rpc-testnet.0g.ai`
- [ ] Wallet connected with A0GI tokens: `0x9B613eD794B81043C23fA4a19d8f674090313b81`
- [ ] MetaMask configured for Chain ID 16600
- [ ] Node.js environment ready (v16+ recommended)

### ‚úÖ **Code Integration**
- [ ] `conservative_gas_optimizer.js` integrated with your oracle
- [ ] `production_monitor.js` configured with alert thresholds
- [ ] Real semantic uncertainty detector connected
- [ ] Gas price monitoring working

### ‚úÖ **Safety Measures**
- [ ] Circuit breaker enabled (3 failure threshold)
- [ ] Manual oversight mode activated
- [ ] Fallback to individual processing enabled
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard ready

## Deployment Steps

### **Day 1: Manual Testing (3-5 batches)**
- [ ] Deploy conservative optimizer with ultra-safe settings
- [ ] Process 3 test batches manually with 2-3 items each
- [ ] Verify each transaction in 0G block explorer
- [ ] Record actual gas costs vs estimates
- [ ] Check accuracy preservation on known test cases

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All transactions confirm within 10 seconds
- [ ] Gas costs within 25% of estimates  
- [ ] No failed transactions
- [ ] Accuracy maintained >85%

### **Day 2-3: Automated Batch Processing (10-15 batches)**
- [ ] Enable automated batching with 3-4 items
- [ ] Process batches every hour during monitoring hours
- [ ] Monitor success rate and gas savings
- [ ] Document any failures or edge cases

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Success rate >80%
- [ ] Gas savings >15%
- [ ] No circuit breaker trips
- [ ] Monitoring alerts working correctly

### **Week 1: Production Volume Testing (50+ batches)**
- [ ] Increase to 4-5 item batches if Day 1-3 successful
- [ ] Process batches continuously with safety pauses
- [ ] Collect comprehensive performance data
- [ ] Generate daily monitoring reports

**Success Criteria for Phase 2:**
- [ ] Success rate >85%
- [ ] Gas savings >20%
- [ ] Processed >50 successful batches
- [ ] System stability proven (no manual interventions)

## Emergency Procedures

### **If Success Rate <70%:**
- [ ] Immediately stop automated processing
- [ ] Reset circuit breaker if needed  
- [ ] Investigate failure causes
- [ ] Return to individual processing mode

### **If Gas Costs >2x Estimates:**
- [ ] Pause batch processing
- [ ] Check network congestion
- [ ] Adjust gas price multiplier
- [ ] Resume with higher safety margins

### **If Accuracy Drops <80%:**
- [ ] Review semantic uncertainty calibration
- [ ] Check for model drift or data issues
- [ ] Temporarily increase uncertainty threshold to 2.5

## Monitoring & Alerts

### **Real-time Dashboards:**
- [ ] Success rate tracking (target: >85%)
- [ ] Gas usage monitoring (target: 15-25% savings)
- [ ] Transaction confirmation times
- [ ] Accuracy preservation metrics
- [ ] Circuit breaker status

### **Daily Reports:**
- [ ] Batch processing summary
- [ ] Cost analysis vs baseline
- [ ] Performance trends
- [ ] Issues and recommendations

### **Alert Thresholds:**
- [ ] SUCCESS_RATE_CRITICAL: <70%
- [ ] SUCCESS_RATE_WARNING: <85%  
- [ ] GAS_VARIANCE: >50% above estimates
- [ ] PROCESSING_TIME: >30 seconds
- [ ] ACCURACY_DEGRADATION: <80%

## Phase 2 Readiness Assessment

After 1 week of Phase 1 operation, assess readiness for Phase 2:

### **Required Metrics:**
- [ ] >85% success rate sustained
- [ ] >20% gas savings achieved
- [ ] >50 successful batches completed
- [ ] Zero manual interventions needed
- [ ] Monitoring system proven reliable

### **Phase 2 Configuration:**
- [ ] Increase batch size to 6-8 items
- [ ] Enable selective storage (‚Ñè‚Çõ ‚â• 1.8)
- [ ] Add basic data compression
- [ ] Reduce batch timeout to 7 seconds
- [ ] Target 30-40% gas savings

## Contact & Support

### **Monitoring Schedule:**
- **Hours:** 9 AM - 6 PM daily during Phase 1
- **Frequency:** Check dashboard every 2 hours
- **Daily Review:** Generate and review daily report

### **Escalation:**
- **Minor Issues:** Document and continue monitoring
- **Major Issues:** Stop processing and investigate immediately
- **Critical Issues:** Emergency stop all batch processing
