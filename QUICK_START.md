# 🚀 Quick Start - High Impact Improvements

## One-Command Execution

### ⚡ Quick Mode (Essential improvements only - ~10 minutes)
```bash
python run_high_impact_improvements.py --quick
```

### 🔍 Comprehensive Mode (All improvements + benchmarks - ~20 minutes)
```bash
python run_high_impact_improvements.py
```

### 🏥 Health Check Only
```bash
python run_high_impact_improvements.py --check-server
```

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Start the semantic uncertainty server:**
   ```bash
   cargo run -p server
   ```

2. **Verify server is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

## What Gets Executed

### 🌍 Natural Distribution Testing
- Tests realistic 5-10% hallucination rates
- Validates on news, medical, legal, creative content  
- Optimizes thresholds for <2% false positives
- **Expected runtime:** ~3-5 minutes

### 🌐 Cross-Domain Validation  
- Trains on QA, tests transfer to dialogue/summarization/creative/code
- Measures performance drop across domains
- Identifies domain-agnostic methods
- **Expected runtime:** ~4-7 minutes

### 🔍 Ensemble Method Analysis
- Deep analysis of all 5 ensemble methods
- Ranks methods by domain-agnostic performance
- Provides production recommendations
- **Expected runtime:** ~3-6 minutes

### 🎯 Additional Benchmarks (Comprehensive mode only)
- Accuracy validation (>90% target)
- Performance benchmarking (<200ms target)
- **Expected runtime:** +5-8 minutes

## Expected Output

### Success Indicators
```
✅ Semantic uncertainty server is running
✅ Completed successfully in 4.2s
🏆 ALL IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
🚀 System ready for production deployment
```

### Key Metrics to Look For
- **F1 Scores**: >0.60 across all domains
- **False Positive Rate**: <2%  
- **Performance Drop**: <25% vs baseline
- **Success Rate**: >80% test cases passing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Running
```
❌ Server not accessible: Connection refused
💡 Please start the server with: cargo run -p server
```
**Solution:** Start the server first, then re-run improvements

### Timeouts/Slow Performance  
```
⏱️ Script timed out after 5 minutes
```
**Solution:** Use `--quick` mode or check Ollama configuration

### Partial Failures
```
✅ Successful improvements: 2/3
⚠️ 1 improvements need attention
```
**Solution:** Check individual script logs, may still be production-ready

## Output Files

After execution, you'll find:
- `high_impact_improvements_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Execution summary
- `enhanced_natural_distribution_results_*.json` - Natural distribution results
- `cross_domain_validation_results_*.json` - Cross-domain analysis
- `ensemble_method_analysis_*.json` - Method comparison results

---

## Production Deployment Decision

### ✅ Deploy if:
- All improvements complete successfully
- F1 scores >60% across domains  
- False positive rates <2%
- Performance within acceptable ranges

### 🔧 Optimize first if:
- <75% success rate on improvements
- Key metrics below thresholds
- Significant performance degradation

### ⚠️ Investigation needed if:
- Server health checks fail
- Multiple timeouts/errors
- Inconsistent results across runs
